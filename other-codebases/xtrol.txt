CONTROLLING HOME-BUILT SCOPES USING GUIDE 4.0 OR 5.0

   Over the last year,  interest in using Guide to control home-built
telescopes has increased greatly.  There are two ways currently provided
for doing this: the "LX-200 clone" method,  and the "DOS IACA" (Inter-
Application Communications Area) method.

   Both systems work through Guide's LX-200 control system.  The only
difference between them (as far as Guide is concerned) is that in the case
of the LX-200,  commands are sent to and read from a serial port,  in ASCII;
in the case of the DOS IACA system,  positions are written to and read from
a region in memory,  in binary form.

METHOD 1:  LX-200 CLONE

   The first method uses the existing LX-200 hookup.  The most common way to
do this involves using an older PC (an 8086 is easily up to the task),  hooked
via serial port to the computer running Guide.  Guide sends and receives
LX-200 commands over the serial port in the normal way,  and the cheap PC
receives and sends commands,  emulating the LX-200.  It processes the
commands into a form usable by the telescope (usually sending commands
directly to stepper motors).

   This system has many advantages.  Foremost is the fact that it gives you
an "LX-200 clone";  any software that supports the LX-200 (most astronomy
software,  these days) will also support your telescope.  The chief drawback
is the need for two computers.  Granted,  the second computer need not
even have a monitor or a hard drive.  But it's still not a desirable thing
to keep around.

   The LX-200 can understand a long list of commands.  Out of that list,
Guide uses only a few:  those to slew to a particular RA/dec,  and to read
the RA/dec where the telescope is pointed.  You may find a need to implement
only one or the other (for example,  if your system provides encoders,  but
no stepper motors).

   The LX-200 accepts data at 9600 baud,  no parity,  one stop bit.

   TO GO TO A PARTICULAR RA/DEC:  The LX-200 expects to receive a 30-byte
command that looks like:

#:Sr 12:34.5##:Sd -67!42##:MS#

   This would slew the scope to an RA of 12h 34.5m,  and a declination of
-67 degrees,  42 minutes.  (The ! is really an ASCII 223,  but I can't put
that in an e-mail message.)  The "Sr" part means "set right ascension",  the
"Sd" part means "set declination",  and the "MS" means "slew the telescope".

   When the LX-200 gets this message,  it sends one byte in reply.  A 48
(ASCII '0') means the scope was slewed.  A 49 (ASCII '1') means the
object was below the horizon.  A 50 (ASCII '2') means it was too close to
the horizon to be seen anyway.

   TO FIND THE RA/DEC WHERE THE SCOPE IS POINTED:  If you send the LX-200
the ten-byte command

#:GD##:GR#

   It then sends back a 15-byte string.  If you were still pointed at the
RA/dec I mentioned above,  the string would look like this:

-67!42#12:34.5#

   Again,  the ! represents an ASCII 224.

   You _could_ use this system.  I know of a few people who have hooked up
cheap PCs to receive the LX-200 commands from good PCs running Guide.  The
cheap PC then interprets the LX-200 commands and produces commands the
homemade telescope understood.

METHOD 2: DOS IACA METHOD

   The DOS Inter-Application Communication Area (IACA) contains 16 bytes
in low memory (from 0000:04f0 through 0000:04ff).  Guide can use this area
to communicate with other DOS programs in general and telescope control
programs in particular.

   This system is currently used by Mel Bartel's ALTAZ system.  Guide runs
in one DOS shell under Windows (or OS/2),  and ALTAZ in another DOS shell.
One can hotkey from one program to the other.  ALTAZ stores the telescope
position in eight bytes in the IACA,  which Guide reads whenever you use
the SLEW GUIDE option in the LX-200 menu.  Going in the opposite direction,
whenever you use the SLEW LX-200 option in Guide's LX-200 menu,  Guide stores
the current screen center (in RA/declination) in the remaining eight bytes
of the IACA;  ALTAZ (or your software) can then read that position and act
accordingly.

   The method works as follows.  The sixteen bytes are treated as four
signed long integers,  at positions 4f0, 4f4, 4f8,  and 4fc.  These values
contain:

   At 4f0:  Guide's RA (in ten-millionths of an RA hour)
   At 4f4:  Guide's declination (in ten-millionths of a degree)
   At 4f8:  The scope's RA (in ten-millionths of an RA hour)
   At 4fc:  The scope's declination (in ten-millionths of a degree)

   From Guide's viewpoint,  you have one remaining task:  to inform Guide that
it should use the IACA,  rather than the (default) LX-200 system.  To do
this,  hit Shift-F10.  You'll be asked to "Enter scope system #:";  enter 3.
You need do this only once;  Guide will store this datum for future use.
